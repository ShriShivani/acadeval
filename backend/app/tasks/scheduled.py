Module 11 — Celery Beat Scheduled Tasks
=========================================
Periodic background jobs that run on a fixed schedule without any human trigger.

Schedule (configured in worker.py celery_app.conf.beat_schedule):
  - refresh_trend_base   : every Sunday 00:00 UTC  — re-crawls Semantic Scholar
  - nightly_correlation  : every night   02:00 UTC  — Pearson correlation between
                           faculty manual scores and system novelty scores
